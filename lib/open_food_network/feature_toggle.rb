module OpenFoodNetwork
  # This feature toggles implementation provides two mechanisms to conditionally enable features.
  #
  # You can provide an ENV var with the prefix `OFN_FEATURE_` and query it using the
  # `ApplicationHelper#feature?` helper method. For instance, providing the ENV var
  # `OFN_FEATURE_NEW_SHINNY_FEATURE` you could then query it from view as follows:
  #
  #   - if feature? :new_shiny_feature
  #     = render "new_shiny_feature"
  #
  # Alternatively, you can choose which users have the feature toggled on. To do that you need to
  # register the feature and its users from an initializer like:
  #
  #   require 'open_food_network/feature_toggle'
  #   OpenFoodNetwork::FeatureToggle.enable(:new_shiny_feature, ['ofn@example.com'])
  #
  # Note, however, that it'd be better to read the user emails from an ENV var provisioned with
  # ofn-install:
  #
  #   require 'open_food_network/feature_toggle'
  #   OpenFoodNetwork::FeatureToggle.enable(:new_shiny_feature, ENV['PRODUCT_TEAM'])
  #
  # You can then check it from a view like:
  #
  #   - if feature? :new_shiny_feature, spree_current_user
  #     = render "new_shiny_feature"
  #
