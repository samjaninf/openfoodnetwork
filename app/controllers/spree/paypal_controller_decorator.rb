  # which creates a brand new Spree::Payment from scratch in PayPalController#confirm
  # However, the 'orphaned' payments are useful when applying a transaction fee, because the fees
  # need to be calculated before the order details are sent to PayPal for confirmation

  # the payment details have been confirmed, but before any payments have been processed
